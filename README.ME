Code Review #12

Notes:

In Githup is uploaded the following:

1. Bootstrap template that was the foundation planning of the Wordpress Theme. I kept this separate and outside of the theme zip.
2. cr12_jamie_slaats_traveler.zip Wordpress Theme for the final work on the Code Review.

Overall, this theme was developed that the key pages would be the category pages. However, the page.php is also set up equal to that of the category.php.

Thanks,
Jamie
